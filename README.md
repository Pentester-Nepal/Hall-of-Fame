# Pentester Nepal - Hall of Fame

**Pentester Nepal**Â is a Nepal-based cybersecurity community that strives to bring together all cybersecurity experts, security enthusiasts, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters under one roof. We've already had several seminars and activities geared at supporting the next generation and supporting community members in learning more about this field. Now, as a way to encourage more learners and show our appreciation for Nepali penetration testers, we've created the "**Hall Of Fame**" repository, which aims to compile a list of all cybersecurity professionals, security enthusiasts, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters, complete with their names, social media handles, and websites.

## Objectives:

There's a purpose for everything, and we're no exception. We're guided by some goals that motivate us to get things done. The following are some of the initiative's key objectives.

-   Assist learners and professionals in getting to know one another.
-   Assist learners in obtaining materials promptly.
-   Because we solely feature Nepali penetration testers, anybody who has a problem understanding the information (blog, walkthrough, research, etc.) may simply question a professional in our language about their difficulty.

## Who are eligible to be inducted into the PTN Hall of Fame?

Anyone who meets the Eligibility Criteria mentioned below can be inducted into the "Hall of Fame."

Even though the cybersecurity industry in Nepal is still in its infancy, we have a large number of well-known specialists. We will attempt to cover them all on our own in the list, but we think we don't even know many others. To fill this void, if you feel you are eligible for inclusion on the list, please click the link below and answer the questions if you feel you are qualified to be included on this list. You'll be in our hall of fame. If you feel we have left someone off the list, you may nominate someone as well.

## Eligibility Criteria:

We've seen a tremendous increase in the number of cybersecurity enthusiasts in the community in recent years, but not everyone is eligible for the "Hall Of Fame." We've established some criteria that we believe are required to help learners find quality write-ups, walkthroughs, videos, research, and other resources from Nepali cybersecurity researchers. One of the most important requirements for eligibility is that the candidate or nominee for the Hall of Fame must be a Nepali national.

**Aside from the aforementioned criteria, at least some of the following conditions must be satisfied to be eligible.**

-   The applicant/nominee must have made a significant contribution to Nepalese cyberspace.
-   Applicant/Nominees shall have written/created content or given talks on cybersecurity events.
-   Applicant/Nominees should have working experience in the cybersecurity industry.
